## ‚≠ê Project Abstract

The goal of this project is to enable the sharing of multiple files in a single message within Rocket.Chat. Currently, the platform only allows users to share one file at a time, which is a significant limitation for many users. Addressing this issue is crucial to meeting user needs and enhancing the overall functionality of the platform.

## üö¢ Deliverables

The following are the deliverables of this project:

- The user can share the multiple files at a time.
- Users can tag another user and can also use all the functionality of the messageBox.
- Users can now send the message while typing in the messagebox.
- Users can get the notification when selecting the files with more size while selecting.
- If selected file size is more than the admin's prescribed so it will show the Toast Message.
- Updated the UI of the files to be shared.
